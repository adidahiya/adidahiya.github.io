My initial idea from the course's first class seemed promising, but I don't think I will pursue it all the way.
Although Elon Musk is somewhat of a polarizing figure and he has been on the collective consciousness lately, I
don't think he's polarizing _enough_ such that I can convince lots of people to either vehemently defend or
disparage him (or his "horcruxes") in the real world.

The direction I'd like to take my class project involves _astrology_, a topic which has seen a resurgence in popularity
this year, especially amongst millenials and on social media. Astrologers already peddle in something that looks and feels
a bit like fake news; horoscopes provide generic insights which seem to be subjectively true to the believer, but have
no real basis in scientific fact.
