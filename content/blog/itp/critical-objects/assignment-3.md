### Technology Critique: Surveillance Conditioning

> concept, background

### Prototype

In class during the prototyping workshop on Feb 25, we tried to create a looks-like and feels-like prototype of the form of the wearable dispenser. We attached some cardboard to a set of headphones and found that the form worked reasonably well. It wasn't too obtrusive to the user and provided us enough space for candy and electronics. This is also when we decided to put the microcontroller in a symmetrically located container on the device (we could have kept the electronics elsewhere, like desk next to the computer which the device is connected to, but this looked better).

Next, we gathered materials to build the real functioning object. Stefan did most of the fabrication while I worked on the Chrome extension which would track user behavior to provide inputs to the electronic system.

Here's Stefan working on the gate dispensing mechanism and overcoming the initial problems we had where the M&Ms would get stuck pushing against each other when the gate was open:

### Final object

In this documentation video you can see Stefan wearing the __Facebook Trainer__ device and browsing the web with our Chrome extension enabled. He is rewarded for actions which keep him within the bounds of the Facebook surveillance network and punished for leaving it.
