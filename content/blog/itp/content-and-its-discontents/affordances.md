### Reading

- _Design of Everyday Things_ (Don Norman), pages 10-36
- [_Rethinking Affordances_, An Introduction](https://schloss-post.com/an-introduction/), (Scarlet and Zeilinger)

### Assignment

> Describe a container (platform/tool/etc.) you use often to create, share, or look at content in terms of affordances, perceived affordances and perhaps too signifiers, constraints, mappings, feedback, and conceptual models.

> Identify a piece of "good content" made for/with that container. How does it leverage the affordances of its container?

### Picking a container

The container I'd like to work with in this class is _Weird Type_, an AR application for iOS designed by Zach Lieberman.
The app is relatively simple; it lets you paint words in space using your iPhone camera. I think it provides some unique artistic
constraints and it combines my interests of mobile photography & typography.

Some notes from my initial idea brainstorming:

- [Weird Type](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weird-type/id1352785248?mt=8) AR app by Zach Lieberman
  - Not many people have made content with this app, it's relatively new and has few downloads (but ardent fans nonetheless)
  - Could potentially get access to developer through ITP network
  - I enjoy working with the iPhone camera and with typography
  - The typographic constraints (monochromatic, only one font, only standard keyboard characters) are interesting
- [Magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) research project with JS implementations of note-based machine learning music models
  - Steeper learning curve since I don't have machine learning experience; I'd probably spend too much time learning the technology to try and make something _good_ rather than getting creative with the tool
- [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) application
  - Inspired by spreadsheet art example shown in first class; instead of office culture, I can draw inspiration from programmer culture
  - Flexible, interactive platform - lots to work with
  - No access to developers, but there are open source terminal emulators I can hack on if necessary
