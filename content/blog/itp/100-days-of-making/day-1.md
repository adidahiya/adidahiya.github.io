### 100 days of mixing

For my 100 days project, I want to create new musical experiences using existing sounds. I want to practice the craft of mixing audio elements together, taking the core task of a DJ as a starting point for my creative exploration. A couple months ago, I started to truly appreciate, and subsequently learn about, the art of selecting interesting music and mixing it in pleasing ways. I've always been an avid music fan making playlists, but only recently did I start actually DJing. I want to quickly deepen my experience with this art form. I want my mixes to have more meaning and purpose behind them. I donâ€™t want to just DJ because there is an available sonic space to fill, I want my DJ sets to exist because they are expressive and have some kind of story to tell.

This project will require:

- collecting and cataloging a large amount of interesting music which I personally enjoy
- analyzing the techniques of other DJs and sound artists to learn what makes their work successful
- creating daily mixes of tracks and sounds

Some possible sound sources could be:

- full-formed song compositions from other artists (the most immediately available source)
- track stems from existing compositions
- simple rhythmic or melodic loops
- drones
- field recordings
- speeches and spoken word recordings

Some tools I plan to use include:

- Pioneer DJ controller / CDJs + mixer
- Ableton Live + Push 2 controller

I'm starting off with a relatively straightforward dance mix of some music I've been listening to recently. Check it out on SoundCloud:
