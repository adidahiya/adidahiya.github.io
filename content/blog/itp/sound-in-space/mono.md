### Monophonic composition

For this assignment, I played around with the Tone.js impulse response & convolver code we were introduced to in class. My goal was to create sound to accompany some of the glitchy video art I created for my first [Live Image performance](../../live-image-processing-performance/week-5). I specifically had the glowing orbs footage in mind; since it (abstractly) evokes a feeling of floating through water and coral reefs, I wanted to create some glitchy bubble & wave sounds.

I took a sample of some glitchy clicks and ran those through a convolver while adjusting the playback rate (this creates a rising pitch effect, corresponding to how bubbles rise in water). You can see the code [here](https://github.com/adidahiya/website/blob/develop/src/pages/projects/sound-in-space/mono.tsx) and interact with the web audio [here](/projects/sound-in-space/mono).

### Installation

I used my [OD-11 speaker](https://www.teenageengineering.com/products/od-11) as my single speaker channel. In my living room, it's positioned underneath the projector area where I played the relevant [video footage](https://vimeo.com/320426987).

The audio in this clip is a little weak, but you can play the piece yourself by going [here](/projects/sound-in-space/mono). The performance is simple; there is only one button to trigger the processed samples, which the performer clicks multiple times during the video playback.
