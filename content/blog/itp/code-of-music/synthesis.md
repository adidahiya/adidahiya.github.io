## Listen

Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith creates amazing sonic landscapes using modular synthesizers. You can hear how she's inspired by forests and nature in this one. The video below is for the whole album _The Kid_, but it's sufficient to hear parts of the first track (_I Am A Thought_) to get the idea.

## Code

(added on October 28)

[Check out my synthesis musical exploration here](/projects/code-of-music/synthesis-sketch).

I took inspiration from Ada's TB-303 sketch because I really liked the acid bass squelch sound. In my interface, I exposed some of the `MonoSynth` parameters more clearly in the form of sliders so that a performer can see what they are inputting into the instrument. I added a simple drum kit track which includes kick, hi hat, and wood block samples.
