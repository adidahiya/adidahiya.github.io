### Reading

- (Optional) [A Tale of Two Clocks - Scheduling Web Audio with Precision](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/)

### Assignments

#### Listen

> Find one or more examples of one of the elements of rhythm, and add it to our [collaborative playlist](https://github.com/luisaph/the-code-of-music-2018/wiki/Collaborative-Playlist) page under Rhythm.

#### Interact

> Pick two [rhythm project examples](https://github.com/luisaph/the-code-of-music-2018/wiki/Examples). Write a short response.

#### Design

> Focusing on one or more of the concepts covered in class, sketch an interface to explore/compose with rhythm. Consider different contexts, materials, users, spaces&mdash;don't limit yourself to what you know how to implement.

#### Code

> Explore and tinker with the [examples above](https://luisaph.github.io/the-code-of-music-2018/#Rhythm) (from 'change the tempo' onwards). Then, create a rhythmic sketch/composition.
