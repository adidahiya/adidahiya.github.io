### Code

[Check out my p5.js sketch for the week here](/projects/code-of-music/melody-sketch).

I used `Tone.Pattern()` to play around with the minor blues scale and some of its harmonies. In this sketch, a constant sixteenth note pattern is playing random notes on a scale. The user can change the notes being played by moving their mouse up and down in the canvas. Higher up in the canvas, the low-frequency notes in the scale are filtered out, so you're left with higher frequencies (and vice versa, for lower in the canvas).
