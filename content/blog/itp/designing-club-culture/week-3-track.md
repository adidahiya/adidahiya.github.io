For this week's assignment, I made a track blending funk & house musical elements. It's a little tough to imagine creating a truly _new_ genre in today's musical landscape, where it seems like most conceivable mixes of major genres have been experimented with by modern music producers. As sampling and music distribution has become more accesible, the number of genre crossovers has exploded. I went with a tried & true genre combination here, hoping to evoke an early 80s house aesthetic.
