What makes "viral content"? How are they the same or not?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>good content has cultural significance, is highly relevant to some (but not necessarily a majority or even plurality) of people</li>\n<li>viral content has high engagement on a platform</li>\n<li>harmful content can still be "good" under this definition (e.g. ISIS propaganda videos)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Is it useful to think of "content" vs. "container"?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes... one is reusable and typically does not change with reuse. Content might be re-used... but only through transformation.</li>\n<li>Another dichotomy which might be useful here is producer vs. consumer categories.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Can content be translated across containers?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, usually... but it might be hard to achieve high fidelity in the translation.</li>\n<li>We are only constrained by the laws of physics, so all translation is possible, in theory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Do you start with a container or with content in your work?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>In the past, I have usually started with container, based on what\'s available at hand (e.g. iPhone + insta) or learning a particular technology and doing tutorials. But I\'d like to change this and try to approach my work content-first.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Are platforms responsible for their content? Do users deserve compensation for user-generated content?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>It would be hard to design a fair system... our fake-detection tech isn\'t good enough yet, so people could game the system if we tried to implement naive compensation economies based on engagement levels.</li>\n<li>Platforms are responsible for harmful content (more so in the digital age where anonymity is easier to achieve (paradigm shift) and community-based policing is harder.</li>\n<li>Marketplaces like Amazon have a stronger imperative to police their content compared to "creative" platforms-</li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{date:"10 September, 2018",title:"Week 0 course questions"},fields:{slug:"/blog/itp/content-and-its-discontents/course-questions/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/itp/content-and-its-discontents/course-questions/"}}}});
