{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>Deep fake progress</h3>\n<p>Today I started using <a href=\"https://www.deepfakes.club/tutorial/\">FakeApp</a> and trained my model. I decided to change my deep fake concept (previously I was planning to do Will Forte &#x3C;> Elon Musk). Now I'm planning to replace Will Forte's face with that of Ben Shapiro in another Comedy Bang! Bang! segment.</p>\n<p>The target clip I'm going to use is from the episode \"David Cross Wears A Red Polo Shirt &#x26; Brown Shoes With Red Laces\" (Season 2, Episode 4) where Will Forte plays a candidate for Senate who claims to have done some pretty horrible things. It's not on YouTube, but you can watch it on Netflix.</p>\n<p>Training data clips for Will Forte: CBB S01E01, CBB S02E04, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SBo5wzn4MI\">this SNL skit</a>.</p>\n<p>Training data clips for Ben Shapiro: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fERROPfODEw\">clip 1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB2VQ30RvUQ\">clip 2</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the CLI tools I used:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\"># download video\nyoutube-dl 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SBo5wzn4MI' -f '[height &#x3C;=? 720]'\n\n# split video into frames\nffmpeg -vf fps=5 -qscale:v 2 'frames-270p/imagename%04d.jpg' -i netflix-screencap.mov\n\n# crop frames to get 500x500 px images of faces\nautocrop -i ./frames-720p -o ./will-forte-frames-720p\n</code></pre>\n<p>I started training in FakeApp with my first batch of images (~380 per face) around 6:20pm today and after about 4 hours, I started to see loss values close to 0.02.\nI hope to come back later and keep training with frames from other clips.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"28 September 2018","title":"Week 3 deep fakes"},"fields":{"category":"faking-the-news","slug":"/blog/itp/faking-the-news/deepfakes-2/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/itp/faking-the-news/deepfakes-2/"}}
