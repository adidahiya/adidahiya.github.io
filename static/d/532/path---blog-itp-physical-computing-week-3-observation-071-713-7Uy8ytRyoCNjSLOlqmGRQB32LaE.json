Write down your assumptions as to how it’s used, and describe the context in which it’s being used. Watch people use it, preferably without them knowing they’re being observed. Take notes on how they use it, what they do differently, what appear to be the difficulties, what appear to be the easiest parts. Record what takes the longest, what takes the least amount of time, and how long the whole transaction takes. Consider how the readings from Norman and Crawford reflect on what you see.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"26 September, 2018","title":"Week 3 - Observation"},"fields":{"category":"physical-computing","slug":"/blog/itp/physical-computing/week-3-observation/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/itp/physical-computing/week-3-observation/"}}
